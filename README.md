# Merkle Airdrop Smart Contract

This repository contains a smart contract for an ERC20 token airdrop that utilizes a Merkle tree for whitelisting addresses. The project teaches how to generate a Merkle root from a list of eligible addresses, implement a Solidity contract to verify claims against this Merkle root, and manage the entire airdrop process.
